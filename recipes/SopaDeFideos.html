    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This <em>sopa de fideos</em> recipe is my version of the tomato noodle soup they give you
        in Mexican restaurants before the meal. This can easily be made at home with just
        a few simple ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) package fideo pasta, uncooked</li>
        <li>3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place tomatoes, onion, and garlic into a blender; pulse several times to get the
            mixture moving, then blend until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; stir in fideo pasta. Fry pasta
            gently, stirring often, until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato mixture into a large saucepan; stir in chicken broth and noodles.
            Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until noodles are tender,
            7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper; stir in cilantro and cook until warmed through.</li>
    </ol>
